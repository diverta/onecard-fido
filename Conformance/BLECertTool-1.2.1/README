Contents
	A number of U2F BLE conformance tests:

		- BLE Transport tests
		- U2F Raw Message tests.
		- Limited ADPU encoding tests

Build Instructions
	To build these tests you will need:

		git clone -b lollipop-release https://android.googlesource.com/platform/system/core/

	If you have git in your path, this will be done automatically during the build.

Supported platforms (tested):
	Windows 10 + Windows Platform SDK 10 + VS2015

Verified hardware:
	Lenovo Thinkpad Bluetooth 4.0 (BCM20702A1)
	USB Orico 4.0 dongle. (CSR8510 A10)

Building for Windows:
	nmake -f Makefile.win
	Use VS2015 project file.

Usage
	By default the test will select the first U2F device reported by Windows.
	You can list the available devices as follows:

		BLECertificationTool.exe -l

	Which will return the device Identifiers of the available FIDO BLE devices.
	You can then run the test on a specific device by doing:

		BLECertificationTool.exe -d "<device identifier>"

Recommended usage:

	BLECertificationTool.exe -v -V -T -S -d "<device identifier>"

Full usage:

	Usage: BLECertificationTool.exe
	 [-h] [-a] [-v] [-V] [-p] [-w] [-e] [-u] [-t] [-i] [-x] [-c] [-l] [ -d <device-identifier>] [-T] [-1.0] [-1.1] [-P <pin>] [-F <file>] [-S]
	  -h   : this text.
	  -a   : Do not abort on failed test.
	  -v   : Verbose
	  -V   : Even more verbose
	  -p   : Pause at failed test
	  -w   : Warnings are treated as errors.
	  -u   : Disable U2F Raw Message tests.
	  -t   : Disable BLE Transport tests.
	  -i   : Disable U2F ISO7816-4 encoding tests.
	  -x   : Disable encrypted connection requirement.
	  -c   : Toggle ANSI colors.
	  -l   : Show all known FIDO BLE devices and exit.
	  -d   : Select specific FIDO BLE device.
	  -T   : turn on BLE level tracing.
	  -1.0 : Select U2F Version 1.0
	  -1.1 : Select U2F Version 1.1 (default)
	  -P   : Provide PIN for pairing.
	  -C   : Device advertises continuously.
	  -F   : Log to file.
	  -S   : Timestamp output.


KNOWN ISSUES:
	* Windows does not always detect advertising devices. This does not resolve itself 
		automatically, please reboot your machine. This might happen after turning on 
		your device or when trying to pair. To see if Windows detects your device,
		keep the Bluetooth settings window open.
	* If logging to file is turned on, sometimes the tests fail with "Error: Unreachable".
		Cause unknown. Please just try again. If this happens often for you, please let 
		me know.

BUGREPORTS
	If you have a problem, please include:
	* Windows version.
	* BLE Hardware + driver version
	* Detailed description of problem
	* If possible, include bluetooth tracings in ASCII format or a link to a free reader 
		for your trace file type.
